# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question: 

### 1.Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    company_dim.name as company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 - $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
